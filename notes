Rev. 1:

All stainless steel design with two 1/4" long 20 mil thick thermal
constrictions. Plugged up easily. Over-estimated thermal resistance of
stainless.

Rev. 2:

Stainless steel heater body with brass heatsink and PEEK insulator. Plug formed
which ended slightly after heatsink and before heater. Clearly heat sink was
sinking enough heat to cool the heater body while not cooling enough to prevent softening.

Rev. 3:

Brass heater body with PEEK insulator.
